## Place Recommendation System
A smart recommendation system that suggests places to users based on their preferences and past interactions. This project leverages Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, and Hybrid Recommendation Models to provide personalized suggestions.

## How It Works:
- Collects user ratings and preferences.

- Uses Machine Learning algorithms to identify similar users and places.

- Generates personalized recommendations based on historical data.

- Enhances accuracy with more user interactions over time.

## Types of Recommendation Models Used:

**Collaborative Filtering** - Finds similar users to suggest places.

**Content-Based Filtering** - Matches places based on attributes.

**Hybrid Model** - Combines both techniques for better accuracy.

## Technologies Used:

**Programming Language:** Python

**Data Processing & Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy

**Machine Learning & Recommendation Models:** Scikit-Learn, SVM, Regression

**GUI:** Tkinter

**Development & Experimentation:** Jupyter Notebook
